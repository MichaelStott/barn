# Barn

Retro 2D game development framework. Heavily inspired by XNA/LibGDX.

This is a personal project not intended for widespread use, but feel free to poke around.

### SDL2

SDL2 will need to be installed locally to run any projects using this framework. Instructions for doing so
can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation).
